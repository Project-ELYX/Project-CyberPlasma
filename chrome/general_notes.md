Theme & behavior reminders

All strokes/fills are class-tintable (currentColor); no hardcoded hex.

Keep EWW overlays above these frames for text/icons and below for the terminal viewport.

Panels are click-through in Command mode except the parts you want interactive (e.g., tabs, file rows).

Everything sits on the 8-px grid and matches the Network panelâ€™s look.
